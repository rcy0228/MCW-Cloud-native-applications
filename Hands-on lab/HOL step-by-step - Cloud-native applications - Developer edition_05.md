# Exercise 1: Create and run a Docker application

**Duration**: 40 minutes

In this exercise, you will take the starter files and run the node.js application as a Docker application. You will create a Dockerfile, build Docker images, and run containers to execute the application.

## Task 1: Test the application

The purpose of this task is to make sure you can run the application successfully before applying changes to run it as a Docker application.

1. Switch to the SSH Shell window, (If you have closed it and need to reconnect, please review the instructions on previous page i.e. "Before the HOL" page.)

1. Type the following command to create a Docker network named `fabmedical`, launch an instance of the mongo db container to use for local testing and confirm that it is running and ready:

    ```bash
    docker network create fabmedical
    
    docker container run --name mongo --net fabmedical -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:4.0
    
    docker container list
    docker container logs mongo
    
    ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, docker container list has been typed and run at the command prompt, and the “api” container is in the list. Below this the log output is shown.](media/Ex1-Task1.4.png "Docker container mongo logs")

1. Next, we will initialize the local database with test content, first navigate to the content-init directory and run npm install.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical/content-init
    npm install
    nodejs server.js
    
    ```
  
   ![This screenshot of the console window shows the output from connecting to mongo.](local/ex1-stp6.png?raw=true "Connect to mongodb")

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows output from running the database initialization.](media/Ex1-Task1.7.png "Run nodejs server.js")

1. Confirm that the database now contains test data.

    ```bash
    mongo
    show dbs
    use contentdb
    show collections
    db.speakers.find()
    db.sessions.find()
    quit()
    
    ```

   This should produce output similar to the following:

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows the data output.](media/Ex1-Task1.8.png "Show database records")

1. Now navigate to the `content-api` directory,  run npm install and Start the API as a background process. Press `ENTER` again to get to a command prompt for the next step.
.

    ```bash
    cd ../content-api
    npm install
    nodejs ./server.js &
    
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, nodejs ./server.js & has been typed and run at the command prompt, which starts the API as a background process.](media/image47.png "Start the mongodb in background")

1. Test the API using curl. You will request the speaker's content, and this will return a JSON result.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3001/speakers
    curl http://localhost:3001/sessions
    
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, made a curl request to view speakers.](media/image47_1.png "Display speaker data")

1. Navigate to the web application directory, run `npm install` and `ng build`. 
    >Note: Wait for the for `npm install` command to complete before proceeding with `ng build`

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce nodejs mongodb-clients
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y

    sudo npm install -g @angular/cli

    cd ../content-web
    npm install
    
    ```

    ```bash
    ng build
    
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, after navigating to the web application directory, nodejs ./server.js & has been typed and run at the command prompt, which runs the application as a background process as well.](media/image48.png "Running web server")

1. You will need the **build agent vm** public IP address, which you can get from **Environment Details** tab.

    ![Edit the app.js file in vim in the build machine to update the API URL.](media/copyip.png)  

1. From the SSH session, we will use the sed command to  edit the `app.js` file and verify it. replace `<AGENT VM IP>` with the IP address copied in the previous step. We will also run the content-web application in the background.

    ```bash
    sed -i 's/localhost:/<AGENT VM IP>:/' app.js
    
    ```

    ```bash
    head app.js
    node ./app.js &
    
    
    ```

   ![Edit the app.js file in vim in the build machine to update the API URL.](media/image27.png "Edit the app.js")

   Press `ENTER` again to get a command prompt for the next step.

1. Test the web application using curl. You will see HTML output returned without errors.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000
    
    ```

    ![Edit the app.js file in vim in the build machine to update the API URL.](local/ex1tsk1-step17.png?raw=true "Edit the app.js")

   > **Note**:  If you get no such file or directory error, run the below command and retry the command /n
   "ng Build"

## Task 2: Browsing to the web application

In this task, you will browse to the web application for testing.

1. Test the web application from a browser. Navigate to the web application using your build agent IP address at port `3000`. Get the Build Agent VM Ip from **Environment Details** tab.

    ```bash
    http://[BUILDAGENTVMIP]:3000
    ```

   > EXAMPLE: ```http://13.68.113.176:3000```

   ![In the Virtual Machine blade, Overview is selected on the left and Public IP address 52.174.141.11 is highlighted on the right.](local/ex1tsk2-step4.png?raw=true "VM Public IP Address")

1. Select the Speakers and Sessions links in the header. You will see the pages display the HTML version of the JSON content you curled previously.

   ![In the Virtual Machine blade, Overview is selected on the left and Public IP address 52.174.141.11 is highlighted on the right.](local/ex1tsk2-step5.png?raw=true "VM Public IP Address")

1. Once you have verified the application is accessible through a browser, go to your SSH window and stop the running node processes.

    ```bash
    killall -9 nodejs
    killall -9 node
    
    ```

## Task 3: Download a Dockerfile

In this task, you will create a new Dockerfile that will be used to run the API application as a containerized application.

> **Note**: You will be working in a Linux VM without friendly editor tools. You must follow the steps very carefully to work with Vim for a few editing exercises if you are not already familiar with Vim.

1. From the SSH session window, navigate to the `content-api` folder. Download a file named `Dockerfile` and verify it is downloaded by listing the contents of the folder 

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical/content-api
    wget http://bit.ly/hol-Dockerfile -O Dockerfile
    ll
    
    ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, ll has been typed and run at the command prompt. The Dockerfile file is highlighted at the top of list.](media/image58.png "Highlight the Dockerfile")

1. Review the `Dockerfile` content.

    ```bash
    cat Dockerfile
    
    ```

    Content should be similar to following:

    >FROM node:alpine AS base
    >
    >RUN apk -U add curl
    >
    >WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    >
    >EXPOSE 3001
    >
    >FROM node:argon AS build
    >
    >WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    >
    >`#` Install app dependencies
    >COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
    >RUN npm install
    >
    >`#` Bundle app source
    >COPY . /usr/src/app
    >
    >FROM base AS final
    >WORKDIR /usr/src/app
    >
    >COPY --from=build /usr/src/app .
    >CMD [ "npm", "start" ]

1. This Dockerfile describes the following:

   - The base stage includes environment setup which we expect to change very rarely, if at all.

     - Creates a new Docker image from the base image node:alpine. This base image has node.js on it and is optimized for small size.

     - Add `curl` to the base image to support Docker health checks.

     - Creates a directory on the image where the application files can be copied.

     - Exposes application port `3001` to the container environment so that the application can be reached at port `3001`.

   - The build stage contains all the tools and intermediate files needed to create the application.

     - Creates a new Docker image from `node:argon`.

     - Creates a directory on the image where the application files can be copied.

     - Copies `package.json` to the working directory.

     - Runs npm install to initialize the node application environment.

     - Copies the source files for the application over to the image.

   - The final stage combines the base image with the build output from the build stage.

     - Sets the working directory to the application file location.

     - Copies the app files from the build stage.

     - Indicates the command to start the node application when the container is run.

## Task 4: Create Docker images

In this task, you will create Docker images for the application --- one for the API application and another for the web application. Each image will be created via Docker commands that rely on a Dockerfile.

1. In the SSH window connected to the build agent VM, type the following command to view any Docker images on the VM. The list will only contain the mongodb image downloaded earlier.

    ```bash
    docker image ls
    
    ```

   ![The node image (node) and your container image (content-api) are visible in this screenshot of the console window.](local/ex1tsk4-step1.png?raw=true "List Docker images")

1. From the content-api folder containing the API application files and the new Dockerfile you created, type the following command to create a Docker image for the API application. This command does the following:

   - Executes the Docker build command to produce the image

   - Tags the resulting image with the name `content-api` (-t)

   - The final dot (`.`) indicates to use the Dockerfile in this current directory context. By default, this file is expected to have the name `Dockerfile` (case sensitive).

    ```bash
    docker image build -t content-api .
   
    ```

   ![The node image (node) and your container image (content-api) are visible in this screenshot of the console window.](local/ex1tsk4-step2.png?raw=true "List Docker images")

1. Once the image is successfully built, run the Docker images listing command again. You will see several new images: the node images and your container image.

    ```bash
    docker image ls
    
    ```

   Notice the untagged image. This is the build stage which contains all the intermediate files not needed in your final image.

   ![The node image (node) and your container image (content-api) are visible in this screenshot of the console window.](media/image59.png "List Docker images")

1. Commit and push the new Dockerfile before continuing.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added Dockerfile"
    git push
    
    ```

   Enter credentials if prompted.

1. Navigate to the content-web folder again and list the files. Note that this folder already has a Dockerfile. View the Dockerfile contents -- which are similar to the file you created previously in the API folder

    ```bash
    cd ../content-web
    ll
    head Dockerfile
    
    ```

   > Notice that the `content-web` Dockerfile build stage includes additional tools for a front-end Angular application in addition to installing npm packages.

1. Type the following command to create a Docker image for the web application.

    ```bash
    docker image build -t content-web .
    docker image ls
    
    ```

   ![two images are now visible in this screenshot of the console window:  content-web, content-api, and node.](media/vm-list-containers.PNG "View content images")

## Task 5: Configure and run the **api** container

The web application container will be calling endpoints exposed by the API application container and the API application container will be communicating with mongodb. In this exercise, you will launch the images you created as containers on the same bridge network you created when starting mongodb.

1. We need to create and start the API application container with the **docker container run** command. The command given below does the following:

   - Names the container `api` for later reference with Docker commands.

   - Instructs the Docker engine to use the `fabmedical` network.

   - Instructs the Docker engine to use port `3001` and map that to the internal container port `3001`.

   - Creates a container from the specified image, by its tag, such as `content-api`.

   - Instructs the Docker engine to set the environment variable by adding the `-e` switch. This is required as without it the `docker container run` command will fail. This is because the image is configured to connect to mongodb using a localhost URL and since it is isolated in a separate container, it cannot access mongodb via localhost even when running on the same docker host. Instead, the API must use the bridge network to connect to mongodb

   - Use the `-d` switch to run the api as a daemon.

    ```bash
    docker container run --name api --net fabmedical -p 3001:3001 -e MONGODB_CONNECTION=mongodb://mongo:27017/contentdb -d content-api
    
    ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, docker container ls has again been typed and run at the command prompt. 0.0.0.0:32768->3000/tcp is highlighted under Ports.](local/ex1task5-step3.png?raw=true "List Docker containers")

1. Enter the command to show running containers. You will observe that the `api` container is in the list. Use the docker logs command to see that the API application has connected to mongodb.

    ```bash
    docker container ls
    docker container logs api
    
    ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, docker container ls has been typed and run at the command prompt, and the "api" container is in the list with the following values for Container ID, Image, Command, Created, Status, Ports, and Names: 458d47f2aaf1, content-api, "docker-entrypoint.s...", 37 seconds ago, Up 36 seconds, 0.0.0.0:3001->3001/tcp, and api.](media/image61v2.png "List Docker containers")

1. Test the API by curling the URL. You will see JSON output as you did when testing previously.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3001/speakers
    curl http://localhost:3001/sessions
    
    ```

## Task 6: Configure and run the **web** container

In this task, you will configure the `web` container to communicate with the API container using an environment variable, similar to the way the mongodb connection string is provided to the api.

1. From SSH session window if we switch to the **content-web** folder and review the `app.js` file, we can observe the highlighted line declaring the **contentApiUrl**  variable, which can be set with an environment variable directive.

    ```bash
    cd ../content-web
    cat app.js
    
    ```
  
   ![In this screenshot of Dockerfile, the CONTENT_API_URL code appears above the next Dockerfile line, which reads EXPOSE 3000.](local/ex1task6-step4.png?raw=true "Set ENV variable")
  
1. Review the Dockerfile.

    ```bash
    cat Dockerfile
    
    ```

1. To set the environment variable, you will need to inject the below line above the `EXPOSE` line shown above.

   >ENV CONTENT_API_URL http://localhost:3001

    The below command will inject the above environment variable directive just above 'EXPOSE 3000' line.

    ```bash
    sed -i "s,EXPOSE 3000,ENV CONTENT_API_URL http://localhost:3001\nEXPOSE 3000,g" Dockerfile
    cat Dockerfile
    
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of Dockerfile, the CONTENT_API_URL code appears above the next Dockerfile line, which reads EXPOSE 3000.](local/ex1task6-step6.png?raw=true "Set ENV variable")

1. Build the web application Docker image using the same command as you did previously. Once done, create and start the image passing the correct URI to the API container as an environment variable. This variable will address the API application using its container name over the Docker network you created. After running the container, check to see the container is running and note the dynamic port assignment for the next step. Since the VM only exposes a limited port range we wil be using using port `3000` using the **-p** switch, on the run command, to test in the browser

    ```bash
    docker image build -t content-web .
    docker container run --name web --net fabmedical -p 3000:3000 -d -e CONTENT_API_URL=http://api:3001 content-web
    docker container ls
    
    ```

   ![In this screenshot of Dockerfile, the CONTENT_API_URL code appears above the next Dockerfile line, which reads EXPOSE 3000.](local/ex1task6-step9.png?raw=true "Set ENV variable")

1. You can now use a web browser to navigate to the website and successfully view the application at port `3000`. Replace `[BUILDAGENTIP]` with the **IP address** you used previously.

    ```bash
    http://[BUILDAGENTIP]:3000
    ```

    >EXAMPLE: http://13.68.113.176:3000

1. Commit your changes and push to the repository, using the commands below. Enter credentials if prompted.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Setup Environment Variables"
    git push
    ```

## Task 7: Push images to Azure Container Registry

To run containers in a remote environment, you will typically push images to a Docker registry, where you can store and distribute images. Each service will have a repository that can be pushed to and pulled from with Docker commands. Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed private Docker registry service based on Docker Registry v2.

In this task, you will push images to your ACR account, version images with tagging, and setup continuous integration (CI) to build future versions of your containers and push them to ACR automatically.

1. In the Azure Portal `(https://portal.azure.com/)`, under navigate select **Resource groups** and click on **fabmedical-{DeploymentID}** resource group. Next, in the resource group page select Azure container registry

   ![This is a screenshot of the selecting resource group.](media/resourcegroup.png?raw=true "SSH Window")

   ![This is a screenshot of acr.](media/acr.png?raw=true "SSH Window")

1. Select **Access keys** under **Settings** on the left-hand menu.

   ![In this screenshot of the left-hand menu, Access keys is highlighted below Settings.](local/ex1task7-step2.png?raw=true "Access keys")

1. The Access keys blade displays the Login server, username, and password that will be required for the next step. Make note of this values, you will be using it in the next part of lab

   > **Note**: If the username and password do not appear, select Enable on the Admin user option.

   ![This is a screenshot of acr.](local/ex1task7-step3.png?raw=true "SSH Window")

1. From the SSH window connected to your build VM, login to your ACR account by typing the following command. Follow the instructions to complete the login.

    ```bash
    docker login [LOGINSERVER] -u [USERNAME] -p [PASSWORD]
    ```

   >For example:
   docker login acr289069.azurecr.io -u acr289069 -p +W/j=l+Fcze=n07SchxvGSlvsLRh/7ga

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, the following has been typed and run at the command prompt: docker login fabmedicalsoll.azurecr.io](media/image65.png "Docker log into container")

   > **Tip**: Make sure to specify the fully qualified registry login server (all lowercase).

1. Run the following commands to properly tag your images to match your ACR account name. List your docker images and look at the repository and tag. Note that the repository is prefixed with your ACR login server name, such as the sample shown in the screenshot below

    > **Note**: Be sure to replace `[LOGINSERVER]` of your ACR instance.

    ```bash
    docker image tag content-web [LOGINSERVER]/content-web
    ```

    ```bash
    docker image tag content-api [LOGINSERVER]/content-api
    ```

    ```bash
    docker image ls

    ```

   ![This is a screenshot of a docker images list example.](media/vm-docker-images-list.PNG "Docker image list")

1. Push the images to your ACR account with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-web
    ```

    ```bash
    docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-api
    ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, an example of images being pushed to an ACR account results from typing and running the following at the command prompt: docker push [LOGINSERVER]/content-web.](media/image67.png "Push image to ACR")

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your ACR account, and select **Repositories** under **Services** on the left-hand menu. You will now see two, one for each image.

   ![In this screenshot, content-api and content-web each appear on their own lines below Repositories.](media/image68spk.png "Search for repositories")

## [Optional] Task 8: Tag container Images

 > **Note**: If time permits, attempt this section of the task otherwise move to the next one.

In this task, you will use features within azure registry to tag and version deployed images.

1. Within the Azure Container registry's repository view, select `content-api`. You will see the latest tag is assigned.

   ![In this screenshot, content-api is selected under Repositories, and the Tags blade appears on the right.](media/image69spk.png "View latest repo tags")

1. From the SSH session attached to the VM, assign the `v1` tag to each image with the following commands. Then list the Docker images to note that there are now two entries for each image: showing the `latest` tag and the `v1` tag. Also note that the image ID is the same for the two entries, as there is only one copy of the image.

    ```bash
    docker image tag [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:latest [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:v1
    ```

    ```bash
    docker image tag [LOGINSERVER]/content-api:latest [LOGINSERVER]/content-api:v1
    ```

    ```bash
    docker image ls
    
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the console window is an example of tags being added and displayed.](media/image70.png "View latest image by tag")

1. Push the images to your ACR account with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:v1
    ```

    ```bash
    docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-api:v1
    ```

1. Refresh one of the repositories to see the two versions of the image now appear.

    ![In this screenshot, content-api is selected under Repositories, and the Tags blade appears on the right. In the Tags blade, latest and v1 appear under Tags.](local/ex1task7-step12.png?raw=true "View two versions of image")

1. Run the following commands to pull an image from the repository. Note that the default behavior is to pull images tagged with `:latest`. You can pull a specific version using the version tag. Also, note that since the images already exist on the build agent, nothing is downloaded.

    ```bash
    docker image pull [LOGINSERVER]/content-web
    ```

    ```bash
    docker image pull [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:v1
    ```
